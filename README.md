## Instructions
> [!WARNING]
> The following applies only to Windows OS. For Mac OS and Linux users, please refer to online resources.

### Creating a Python Environment
1.) Download and install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda Navigator</a>. </br>
> [!NOTE]
> The **Anaconda Navigator** provides a hassle-free installation of the components needed to run Jupyter Notebook.

2.) Open the **Anaconda Prompt** and create an environment. Replace `envname` with your preferred environment name:</br>
```
conda create -n envname python anaconda -y
```
> [!TIP]
> A good rule of thumb is to create a Python virtual environment so we can start fresh. This prevents conflict with other applications that need certain dependencies and versions.

3.) Activate the virtual environment:
```
conda activate envname
```
4.) Install IPython:
```
pip install ipython
```
> [!NOTE]
> We use **IPython** as it allows our notebooks to be interactive. Additionally, it contains extensions needed for data and numerical plotting.

### Navigating Jupyter Notebook
5.) Open Jupyter Notebook. The application will be launched via a web browser with a new tab named **Home**.
```
jupyter notebook
```

6.) Navigate to the folder where the MNIST dataset is located. Create a notebook by clicking the **New** button, then select **Python 3 (ipykernel)**. The new notebook should look similar to the image presented below.
