# Let-s-Build-A-Neural-Network
A walkthrough on the basics of neural networks and how to code them from scratch using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Outline
● Quick Jupyter Notebook/Python review;</br>
&emsp;⚬ Print;</br>
&emsp;⚬ For loops; and</br>
&emsp;⚬ Arrays.</br>
● Creating functions and initialising the network;</br>
● Initialise weights;</br>
● Query the network; </br>
&emsp;⚬ Matrix computation; and</br>
&emsp;⚬Activation function.</br>
● Build the training function;</br>
&emsp;⚬ Compute signals between layers;</br>
&emsp;⚬ Error computation; and</br>
&emsp;⚬ Update weights.</br>
● Preparing the MNIST dataset; </br>
&emsp;⚬ Training data; and</br>
&emsp;⚬ Testing data.</br>
● Testing the network; and</br>
● Tweaking the network. </br>
&emsp;⚬ Adjusting the learning rate;</br>
&emsp;⚬ Multiple runs;</br>
&emsp;⚬ Changing network shapes; and</br>
&emsp;⚬ Simple data augmentation using rotations.</br>

## Instructions
### Creating a Python Environment
1.) Download and install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda Navigator</a>;</br>
2.) Open the Anaconda Prompt and create an environment;</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ```conda create -n envname python anaconda -y```</br>
3.)
